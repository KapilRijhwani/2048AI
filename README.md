2048 Game AI
PROJECT OVERVIEW

BOARD VIEW
  	MAINTAIN HIGH SCORE
  	CURRENT SCORE
  	DETERMINE GAME OVER SITUATION

CREATE A GRID

CREATE TILES
  	POSITION
  	VALUES
  	COLOURS

KEYBOARD INTERACTION
 
  	MAP KEYBOARD EVENTS WITH UP DOWN LEFT AND RIGHT MOVEMENTS

GAME PLAY
  	LOOK FOR POSSIBLE MERGES WITH SIMILAR VALUED TILES
  	IF MERGE CHANGE VALUE AND COLOR OF TILE AND CLEAN UP EXTRA TILE
  	KEEP SCORE: DEPENDING UPON THE TILES AND CORR VALUE SCORES IS INCREASED
  	GAME OVER: IF NO MORE TILES LEFT AND NO CURRENT MERGE TILE IN LAST MOVE
  	GAME WIN: 2048 TILE ACHIEVED

APPLICATION PARAMETERS
  	SETTING ANIMATION DELAY TIME
  	SETTING MIN SEARCH TIME FOR MIN MAX TREE DEPTH DECIDING FACTOR
  SMOOTHNESS AND MONOTONICITY

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
  	WHEN RUN WITH 100 MS MIN MAX SEARCH TIME IT GIVES 90% SUCCESS RATE IN 50 GAME TRIALS
  	MONOTONICITY :  INCREASES PROBABLITY THAT TILES ARE ARRANGED IN INCREASING OR DECR ORDER ACROSS A ROW/COLOUMN OR BOTH.
  	THIS REGARDS TO THE GAMING APPROACH THAT HIGHER VALUED TILES MUST BE CLUSTERED IN A CORNER.
  	 
  	MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH FREE TILES AVAIL ELSE GAME COULD GET OVER QUICKLY ELSE GIVE A PENALTY
  	SMOOTHNESS ENSURES THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADJACENT TILES SHOULD BE ABLE TO  MERGE EASILY
  	 PERFECTLY SMOOTH GRID 
  	EVALUATION FUNC CALCULATED AFTER EVERY MOVE TO DETERMINE EFFECIENCY OF MOVE
  	FORMULA THIS.GRID.SMOOTHNESS * SMOOTH WEIGHT+
  	                    THIS.GRID.MONOTONICITY*MONO2WEIGHT+
  	 	       MATH.LOG(EMPTY CELLS)*EMPTY WEIGHT+
  		      THIS.GRID.MAXVALUE*MAXWEIGHT


ALPHA BETA DEPTH FIRST SEARCH
  	ALPHA BEST VALUE MAX CAN FORCE
  	BETA IS THE BEST VALUE MIN CAN FORCE
  	ALPHA BETA VALUES ARE PASSED TOP DOWN WHEREAS MIN MAX VALUES ARE PASSED BOTTOM UP
  	APHA BETA PRUNING DEPENDS UPON TRAVERSAL OF NODES
  	IN MIN NODE WE MODIFY ONLY BETA IN MAX ONLY ALPHA
  	TIME COMPLEXITY REDUCES TO O(B^(D/2)) INSTEAD OF O(B^D) 
  	B – BRANCHING FACTOR D-DEPTH OF TREE

CSS
  	TO LAYOUT DESIGN OF
  	GRID 
  	TILES
  	TILE MOVEMENTS
  	SCORE BOARD AND 
  	GAME OVER

FURTHER DEVELOPMENT POSSIBLE
  	TO DESIGN ALGO TO PLACE NEW TILES(WITH VALUE 2 AND 4) IN WORST POSSIBLE PLACE
  	LIKE MEDIUM(25% WORST POSSIBLE CASE POSITION) AND HARD(50% WORST POSSIBLE CASE POSITION)
